# MindGame (Work In Progress)
## A game which you win by not thinking about it.


Using a BITalino device, this game compares the EEG readings of the two players. Like the rules of a tug-of-war, the player who gives an EEG reading closer to the base line for a long enough time wins the game.


*Note that this is a TTY game*


### Devices Required:

A BITalino with bluetooth enabled and two EEG sensors connecting to channel A1 and A2.


The python script has been tested on Ubuntu MATE on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B


Note that this game does not work on macOS
