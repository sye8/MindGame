# MindGame
## A game which you win by not thinking about it.


Using a BITalino device, this game compares the EEG readings of the two players. Like the rules of a tug-of-war, the player who gives an EEG reading closer to the base line for a long enough time wins the game.


*Note that this is a TTT game*
